<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Software Engineer, Source Capital AG</h3>

<h4>Zug, Switzerland</h4>

<h5>September 2010 - June 2013</h5>

<p>Worked in a team that was responsible for building and maintaining an in-house proprietary trading system in C++ on Linux for low latency algorithmic trading on a global scale.</p>

<p>Over three years I have been involved in projects across the whole trading system, mostly using my expertise in performance improvements and stability/quality. I have also built several exchange connections for market data and trading. This have given me expert insight into technologies from Euronext Liffe, OM, SOLA, FIX, FIX FAST etc. Many of the market connectivities I completely re-wrote to meet the quality and latency demands. I&#8217;ve also worked on CME and Eurex technologies.</p>

<p>Selected into a small team to be responsible for all low latency development and trading operations. This was provided a great opportunity to share knowledge with the other team members who were very skilled in hardware/network as well as trading algorithms. During this time I mentored the team members including traders in the overall trading system architecture and how to design for low latency. I worked closely with infrastructure engineers to optimize the full hardware/software stack for every microsecond. Our team successfully reached the given goals to show a well-functioning team that delivers what is required. This success lead to a transformation of the company structure so it better can execute on business needs.</p>

<p>My projects have resulted in several orders of magnitude performance, quality and robustness improvements and this allowed the company to successfully enter the ultra low latency scene.</p>

<p>Advocated proper software practices such as building for quality, unit testing, build automation, Continuous Integration, automated testing, pair programming, versioning and release management.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> C++, STL, boost, ASIO, multithreading, multi-core, TCP/IP, UDP, IP multicast, FIX, FIX FAST, market data, Solarflare, low latency, optimization.</p>

<h3>Software Engineer, Actant AG</h3>

<h4>Zug, Switzerland</h4>

<h5>October 2007 - August 2010</h5>

<p>Worked as a software engineer building a market making platform on Microsoft Windows. This is sold globally to small-, mid- and large financial companies that do options market making.</p>

<p>Initially worked more on support, maintenance and some feature development. Over time I helped introduce Scrum and mentored colleagues to understand the new process and what it meant in the daily activities. I also worked hard to assist product management with introducing a tool to manage work, prioritize and have visibility of what is going on. I also designed and implemented most of the Continuous Integration process and workflow that fully automated everything from code change to getting a tested installable from an archive. This work was further extended to handle multiple releases.</p>

<p>Worked on a performance projects that e.g. improved the throughput of the main event loop of the application two orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>The last year I worked in a small team that worked on core components for interconnecting distributed applications and especially having remote GUIs written with Qt. This work included designing and implementing a full service-oriented architecture layer for a distributed system.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> C++, boost, market making, performance optimization, SOA, networking, remote GUI technology, Qt, Continuous Integration, unit testing, automation, Scrum.</p>

<h3>Software Engineer, Nokia Networks</h3>

<p>Helsinki, Finland<br/>
Jan 2006 - June 2007</p>

<p>Part of the team designing and implementing the Nokia MMS solution in C++ for HP-UX and later Linux.</p>

<p>Initially responsible for one of the main MMS interfaces (MM7) to later taking the lead in the overall porting of the entire MMS system from HP-UX to Linux. This was a very large undertaking and we successfully achieved it by good coordination and integration of lower level components into higher level systems.</p>

<p>In my work I was advocating process improvements in order to achieve better teamwork, software quality and visibility of project status. This meant helping people understand things like Agile, Scrum, Continuous Integration, unit testing, pair programming and estimation techniques.</p>

<p>During the porting of the solution to Linux I started to get involved in the open source software evaluation process at Nokia as they were pushing to start using much more open source components than before.</p>

<p>I demoed to upper management successfully sending an MMS message through the Linux MMSC for the very first time.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> C++, multithreading, messaging, MMS, Linux, porting, API, Scrum, Continuous Integration.</p>

<h3>Software Engineer (Master thesis), Nokia Networks</h3>

<h4>Helsinki, Finland</h4>

<h5>May - December 2005</h5>

<p>Designed and develop the MM7 interface for the MMS center as part of my Master thesis. This work included designing and developing a library to handle the MM7 protocol as well as client and server applications. The work was done in C++.</p>

<p>During this time I got to know Scrum and other Agile software methodologies through Craig Larman and Bas Vodde that were evangelizing this at Nokia. Two of the founders of Scrum, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland also had trainings at Nokia that I participated in. I quickly became very passionate about Scrum and helped to get things implemented in our 30+ person team. It was a great time and I learnt a lot setting up Continuous Integration, unit testing, pair programming and refactoring.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> C++, MMS, API design, networking, Scrum, Continuous Integration.</p>

<h3>Project Manager, TKK-Nokia project</h3>

<h4>Helsinki, Finland</h4>

<h5>October 2004 - April 2005</h5>

<p>Arranged to get a project from Nokia for the upcoming project course while I was working as an intern. I assembled a team of six which included a stakeholder from Nokia. The goal of the project was to build an internal tool for the Nokia infrastructure team to manage resources such as servers, laptops, meeting rooms etc. The project utilized the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Project Management, Agile, Web application, Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL.</p>

<h3>Summer Intern, Nokia Networks</h3>

<h4>Helsinki, Finland</h4>

<h5>May - September 2004</h5>

<p>Worked as a summer intern in the team that provides the Nokia Multimedia Messaging Service solution (MMSC). Here I initially spent time automating client/server tests with shell scripts which went much faster then expected so I ran out of work. After this I started to help out with other things and built some internal tools to help with merging code.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Shell scripting, C++, TCP/IP, client/server, test automation.</p>

<h3>Freelance Software Developer, Kemira Oyj</h3>

<h4>Vasa, Finland</h4>

<h5>June - August 2003</h5>

<p>Due to our previously successful project we got another project to deliver a measurement application of fluorescent lights in a production line for polymers. Technically this was very similar to the other application - i.e. both Windows applications connected to an external device for input.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> freelance project, design, implementation, Windows, Visual Basic 6.</p>

<h3>Freelance Software Developer, Kemira Oyj</h3>

<h4>Vasa, Finland</h4>

<h5>May - September 2002</h5>

<p>Designed and built an application to help performing lab measurements of polymers. The application was programmed with Visual Basic 6 for Windows and it used an external device for input. Through this project I learned how to work with clients, gather requirements and how to deliver a working solution that solves a real problem.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> freelance project, design, implementation, Windows, Visual Basic 6.</p>

<h3>Summer Intern, Nokia</h3>

<h4>Salo, Finland</h4>

<h5>June - August 2002</h5>
